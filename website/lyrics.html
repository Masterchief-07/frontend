            [Verse 1]
We're talkin' away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be comin' for your love, okay?

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So, needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, things that you say, yeah
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be comin' for you anyway

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

[Outro]
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)
I'll be gone (Take on me) (Take on me)
In a day (Take me on) (Take on me)
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)
(Take on...)
